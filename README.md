# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

- [x] Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
![Alt Text](SQL-Injection.gif)

Walkthrough
  1. Go to a saleperson profile (ex. /blue/public/staff/salespeople/show.php?id=1)
  2. After the link, inject SQL (‘ OR SLEEP(5)=0--‘)

- [x] Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
![Alt Text](Session-Hijacking.gif)

Walkthrough
  1. An unknown user(attacker) changes the PHPSESSION of the site. (using: https://35.225.30.145/blue/public/hacktools/change_session_id.php)
  2. When admin is logged in, attacker is able to steal the session of the admin and can bypass logging in with username and password.


## Green

- [x] Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration
![Alt Text](User-Enumeration.gif)

Walkthrough
  1. Login and type a username you know exists on the database and type a wrong password
  2. A username that exists on the database with a wrong password will be printed in bold
  3. But a username that does not exist with inputted wrong password will not be in bold

- [x] Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
![Alt Text](Cross-Site-Scripting.gif)

Walkthrough
  1. Go to the Contact Form of the website and write a comment/feedback
  2. In the comment section, inject XSS script (<script>alert("XSS Attack")</script>)


## Red

- [x] Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
![Alt Text](IDOR.gif)

Walkthrough
  1. When you check the list of salesperson on the site, there is an extension of an id parameter which is flawed and exploitable.
  2. Change the id parameter until you get a hidden/unknown/secret employee/salesperson (id=10, id=11)

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)


## Notes

CSRF is not working properly for me
